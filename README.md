# nomadgroups.wiki

Welcome to the Digital Nomad Community Directory! This project aims to create a comprehensive list of online communities and groups specifically catered to digital nomads. Whether you're a seasoned nomad or just starting your remote work journey, this directory will help you connect with like-minded individuals, find support, and discover exciting opportunities around the world.

## The list

üëâüèª Click [HERE](directory.md) to open the list

## üóÇÔ∏è How the Directory Works

This project uses three main files:

1. **`data.yaml`** - The **source of truth** where all data is stored and maintained
2. **`schema.json`** - Defines the structure and validation rules for the directory data
3. **`directory.md`** - The human-readable file that's automatically generated from the YAML data

> **Important:** Always make changes to `data.yaml`, NOT the markdown file. The markdown file is automatically generated and any direct changes will be overwritten.

## ü§ù How to Contribute

We welcome and appreciate all contributions to this directory! Here's how you can add new groups:

### Adding a New Group

## üîß Technical Information

### Automated Workflows

This repository uses GitHub Actions for automation:

1. **Validation Workflow**
   - Runs on every pull request
   - Validates data against schema.json
   - Ensures data integrity

2. **Markdown Generation**
   - Triggers on data.yaml updates
   - Automatically regenerates directory.md
   - Maintains consistency

### Schema Details

The `schema.json` file enforces:
- Valid platform values
- Correct continent names
- Proper URL formats
- Required and optional fields
- Data type validation

For complete validation requirements, refer to [schema.json](schema.json).
